A Python Linux From Scratch Automation

As an excersice in futility, trying to get a Dockerfile to build a Linux From Scratch Docker container from scratch with a multi stage build.
Where in regular LFS at a certain stage you chroot, here I use the docker from scratch building steps to achieve a similar result.

Currently more or less have it working up to chapter 8
